“Absolutely love , love this can. You have to purchase 4 D batteries and or online get an adapter that is made for it.”
<p>
“The can arrived packaged very well. This is very important because you aren't immediately worried about a damaged product. This is a very sturdy and decorative indoor waste can. Easy to clean. I love how the cover opens and closes automatically ( I purchased the adapter) and that it has its own deodorizer. It doesn't take up a lot of space and is more attractive than a plain plastic trash can. Would recommend this product very highly.”
<p>
“This is a terrific product for your kitchen especially or any place that needs a large disposal. We had the previous generation can for about 20 years ( needing to replace the opening top after about 10 years). Quality is very good. Sensor works well and keeps the lid open for about 6 seconds allowing you to dispose most anything without touching any buttons. Nothing to lift or pedal to push to get it open. Bags can be removed easily and new one replaced in a jiffy. Definitely recommend.”

Product broke after a few months. It was still under warranty, but they want the consumer to pay them an extra $15 to fix their mistakes. Also it smudges, doesn’t eliminate odor, and the motion sensor frequently sets itself off. They decided to put the close button and the locking mechanism on opposite sides of the sensor, so when you press the close button it immediately reopens when you move your hand to lock the lid. This a bad product sold by an even worse company.
<p>
The product description states 13 gallon however, the actual size is much smaller. I would have returned the item due to the ridiculous size difference but my husband had already torn the box and Home Depot stated I couldn’t return it without the box. It was a project just to assemble the trash can as well. Too many tiny screws!!!
<p>
NOT WORTH THE PRICE. I never ordered a trash bin before so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I assumed that a 13 gallon was the average size for kitchen trash bins but this just seems extremely small to me. I made this purchase knowing that it was motion sensing and odorless technology so I expected it to either be battery operated or plug - in. It is plug in... But you have to purchase the AC adapter separately as well as everything else that makes it "techy". So for the price I paid I just received a regular trash bin that I have to manually open and deal with smells unless I buy the rest of the kit. I'll be returning this as soon as possible and I will purchase a regular trash bin instead for much cheaper. Lesson learned.

“As a gadget junkie, I couldn't resist trying out this trash can—even though I didn't necessarily need it. Its slim and sleek design fits perfectly next to my kitchen setup without being an eyesore. What really sets it apart are the high-tech features: it seals itself with heat, lifts and lowers automatically, and even replaces the bag—super cool! My only minor complaint is that I wish the opening were a bit wider. The Motion sensor works accordingly and it seems to be sturdy. I purchased this item on sale so the value for me was okay.”
<p>
“I really love this garbage can. Once I figured out what “full” looks like for the automatic sealing mechanism, it’s been everything I hoped for. A helpful tip: if the bag doesn’t cut cleanly after sealing, it’s probably slightly overfilled—just press down the top a bit manually, and it should work perfectly.
<p>
One of the best features is the rechargeable battery. I honestly forget it even needs charging because it lasts for months—I think it’s been at least 3 months since the last charge.
<p>
The lights inside the can are a cute touch, though they’re more for novelty than practical use. I did knock off one star because the motion sensor isn’t quite sensitive enough. I usually have to wave my hand right up close—or even touch it—to get the lid to open.
<p>
Overall, it’s a fantastic product with smart features and a sleek design. Just wish the motion sensor worked a little better!”
<p>
“Had this trash can for well over a year now. So much better than Simple Human. Love that out has an open lid mode and bags the trash and refills the bag. It talks to me like a robot. Super awesome. Also freaks out the cat, which is always amusing. The sensor also works consistently, unlike our SH can in the kitchen. Also like that is rechargeable and I don't have to recharge it often; I recharge it a few times a year. This trash can is just cool - I LOVE IT! ❤️ Smart people designed it.”
<p>
Negative:
<p>
“Complete rip off, do not buy. 1st, I've never understood why vendors will sometimes take a small box and put it inside a box 3x its size without padding to ship an item. This is far worse than just shipping the original box on its own. The item is going to bang around inside that larger box and the shippers have no idea the thing that matters is inside the larger box. So naturally it came and the interior box that was taped up 1000x to hold it together for shipping was super damaged. This is the mark of a company that has no idea what its doing. Secondly, I have never, in trying 5 times, had a bag seal itself up after pressing the button. It opens and the bag is 30% sealed and that seal breaks as soon as you look at it. Thirdly, the opening to this trash bin is too narrow so its often not very helpful when you want to dispose of trash. Fourthly, the sensor used to open the top lid is often on strike. It simply refuses to acknowledge my presence. I need to perform some type of ritualistic dance to get the thing to open up .”
<p>
I had high hopes for the Airdeer Automatic Trash Can, but unfortunately, it has been a huge disappointment. Despite its promising features, this 4-gallon self-sealing and self-changing smart trash can has not lived up to my expectations.
<p>
Firstly, the motion sensor is extremely finicky. Sometimes it responds, but more often than not, I find myself waving my hand multiple times just to get it to open. This defeats the purpose of a touchless trash can and has become quite frustrating.
<p>
The self-sealing and self-changing mechanism is another major issue. It frequently jams and fails to seal properly, leaving me with a mess to clean up. The trash bags are also quite flimsy and tear easily, which is not what I expected from a product designed for convenience.
<p>
Additionally, the lid doesn't always close securely, leading to unpleasant odors escaping into the kitchen. For a trash can with a lid, this is a fundamental flaw.
<p>
The refill rings are supposed to make things easier, but they are overpriced and don't last nearly as long as advertised. I find myself constantly needing to replace them, adding to the overall cost and hassle.

“Opens automatically and also seals the bag when full.
<p>
Sure it opens automatically like other trash cans. But it also seals the trash bag and drops a new one in its place after you remove the sealed bag. The bag refills have 20 each, you can get 12 or 24 pack refills on airdeer online shop. Has a power cord but also a built in battery so don't have to always have it plugged in. Works great in my bedroom, when they come out with tall kitchen size I will get a few of those.”

“Love it! I purchased this for my 83 year old mom to use in her bathroom. She loves it!”
<p>
“I purchased the trashcan for my bathroom. I admit that the purchase is a bit frivolous. Spending that much money on a trash can for the bathroom is a bit crazy...BUT, money aside, I really do love it. I love that it seals up the bag so quickly and well. I love how the bag opens up and fills the bin without the puffs of air that can typically get trapped between the bag and bin. We've had it for a few weeks now and typically have a full can every week. It's still on the same charge and same bag container provided. A bit pricy, but I think it was worth it.”

I feel as though this is a fixable problem, I just don't know how to fix it.”

<p>
“Works great. Too soon to tell on battery life but so far, so good. Trash bags are a little tricky to put in but gets easier with practice. The air sucking the trash bag open in the can is really neat and works really well - just be careful not to get the trash bag over the opening when installing a new trash bag.”

“We ordered two at the same time. One worked immediately, great. The other does not work. Installed batteries, no light indicating power. Tried another set of batteries, just in case - nothing. While not ideal, I understand that; however, what is very frustrating is that I now have to take the time to find and coordinate to take the non-functioning item I already paid for to a place convenient for Amazon. Amazon drops things off at my house almost daily, literally 5+ times a week, yet they can't pick up something which was broken upon delivery? 50% of the items I purchased functioned and now I have solve to return the one which was broken. Very frustrating.”
<p>
“I have two of these and I like the first one I bought very much. The second one goes in a bathroom that is very seldom used. I know it has been over the time for a return, but this thing will not raise the lid and has a very loud noise trying to do so. It has not been used more than 5 0r 6 times. I am very disappointed in the product and that it takes longer than the 31 days to break when not used. The price of the product is not worth the aggravation. I intend on getting another one but believe me I will open it several times a day to see if it is worth it. I am very disappointed in Amazon selling such a worthless product.”
<p>
“Pure junk! The trash can did not even make it one month before the lid stop functioning. The plastic gears are very flimsy and all they do is click and make noise and never open. To make matters worse, The return window was not even one month so I'm stuck with this trash can. I guess I'll throw it in the real trash.”

“They are VERY roomy, very sturdy, very modern, easy to clean, has a liner clip to neatly hold down the top of the bag, and it works well. The only con is there should be a manual backup foot pedal to open the lid when the batteries are low. It takes about 4 big round D batteries. The bags aren't cheap either so these cans are a true luxury.”
<p>
“I have bought this trash can in the past and it performed perfectly and looks amazing. This time though the lid was not working correctly. it would only open half way. Very frustrating. inside the package it has a notification to contact the customer service for problems. So instead of having to bring the can into the store to return it I decided to contact them. They ran though some basic trouble shooting and reset procedure. Unfortunately it did not work. They sent a whole new lid instead of making me return anything. Great customer service!!! Lid worked perfectly. Sometimes you get a great product from a great company and something might be wrong with it. Its how the Company stands behind the product with their customer service that makes it an amazing product!”
<p>
“Have had it for 2 days, a pleasure to use every time. The height is great, nice capacity, without even filling fully. And- hands free is the best, with food anything in your hands. I see it as a little pricey, but a good %26 practical investment. Probably helps with pet issues, my dog is very small- but could tip the 21 gallon garbage can if able to grab of the bag.”
<p>
“This is a great addition to my steel appliances in my kitchen ! It was marked at a great price for the holiday shopping and does wonders with a full bin for trash. Less trips to my garbage can outside lol - The top is an automatic open but it doesn’t open full everytime - however I’m happy with it. It takes 3 D batteries in the top cover of the can to operate the functions open/close. There are two buttons that also do the same functions on the can liner cover.”

Loved the idea and the look of this trash can, however it stop working after 3 months. We changed the batteries and did everything we could and it still won't work. And warranty is only good for 90 days according to Walmart. Very disappointed with this trash can.
<p>
i typically wouldnt spend more than $20 on a garage can but I thought I would give it a shot. I wish I didnt. The lid stopped working about the 5th time it opened. the sensor still works but the lid will only open about an inch. I attempted all the troubleshooting directions in the manual and online but nothing works. I attempted to reach out to the company by using the email and number provided. My email was not sent due to "the email you provided does not exist." I still have not heard from the company.
<p>
Had this less than three weeks when the battery department started to come loose. Batteries keep slipping down so it won't work. Have to fix batteries. Now the can is malfunctioning it open and closes constantly and it's so annoying. And it runs the batteries down. Struggles
